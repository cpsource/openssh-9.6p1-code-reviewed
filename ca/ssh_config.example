# ssh_config.example — Certificate-related additions for frflashy.com clients
#
# These lines go into /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts and /etc/ssh/ssh_config
# on every machine that connects to frflashy.com.
# See README-cert.md for the full setup guide.
#
# After running ca/setup-ca.sh, deploy trust to each client with:
#   sudo bash -c 'printf "@cert-authority frflashy.com,*.frflashy.com "; \
#       cat ca/ssh_host_ca.pub' >> /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts

# --- /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts ---
# Trust any host certificate signed by the Host CA for frflashy.com.
# Replace <CA_PUBLIC_KEY> with the full contents of ca/ssh_host_ca.pub.
#
# @cert-authority frflashy.com,*.frflashy.com <CA_PUBLIC_KEY>


# --- /etc/ssh/ssh_config (or ~/.ssh/config) ---
# Optional: reject keys/certs listed in the KRL (from ca/revoke-host-key.sh).
# Deploy the KRL to clients after any revocation:
#   scp ca/revoked.krl root@clienthost:/etc/ssh/revoked_host_keys.krl
#
# Host frflashy.com
#     RevokedHostKeys /etc/ssh/revoked_host_keys.krl
