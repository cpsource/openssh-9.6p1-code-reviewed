# known_hosts.example — CA trust line for frflashy.com clients.
#
# After running ca/setup-ca.sh, deploy this trust to every machine
# that connects to frflashy.com:
#
#   sudo bash -c 'printf "@cert-authority frflashy.com,*.frflashy.com "; \
#       cat ca/ssh_host_ca.pub' >> /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts
#
# Or copy this file (with the placeholder replaced) to:
#   /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts   (system-wide, preferred)
#   ~/.ssh/known_hosts         (per-user)
#
# The @cert-authority marker tells SSH to trust any host certificate
# signed by this CA for connections to frflashy.com and its subdomains.
# No TOFU prompt will appear for any server presenting a valid certificate.
#
# Replace <PASTE_CONTENTS_OF_ca/ssh_host_ca.pub_HERE> with the actual
# public key after running ca/setup-ca.sh.
